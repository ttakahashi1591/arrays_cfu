### Arrays Self Evaluation Questions
- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far? 
    - Since I have a strong background with Google Sheets, learning the concept of Arrays seems fairly easy. I am confident with understanding the parts of the Array and being able to utilize technical language to describe what is going on with the Array. I do think the methods will take some time to learn, but most of the ones we discussed in this lesson seem to make sense when you get the output which really helped with determining the method's purpose. 
- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before the next lesson? 
    - I do beleive that I am ready for the next lesson. I feel that as I start to utilize the methods, I will soon memeorize the oens that are most relveant to my work and now have the Ruby Docs link bookmarked so I can reference it whenever I come across an unknown method or if I may need to determine what method is necessary for a particular project. 
- What questions fo you have about Arrays? 
    - I am curious if there is a more effective way to add the data into the Arrays so the elements can somewhat auto-populate. I am sure there is a way to do this as it is very time consuming and there is a potential error risk to add each element one one if you are working with large data sets.
